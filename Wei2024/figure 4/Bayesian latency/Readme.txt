codeforFig8.m : Bayesian Tracking, assistant folders, especially .\inference\getDefaultTrackingParam2, set bayesian parameters
codeforFig9.m : Kalman Tracking, KalmanTracking3, supposing that tracking is a linear problem
codeforFig10.m : LSTM Tracking, LSTMTracking6, for noise data, everytime the result is different slightly, since the added noise is random.
codeforFig12.m : LSTM Tracking, LSTMTracking6, for missing data, the sliding window size is different, respectively 30,20,12.
codeforFig11_!3.m : MOCAIP Tracking, average of a segment of data, the segement length has to be great than the length of the missing data (+2).
